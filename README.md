# ExpenseTracker
This is a java FX project where the user can track their expenses and it compares all your expenses using a Table View to your budget. 
And calculates the total expenses and tells you if you are over and under budget. 

At the top of the app there are text fields in which you can enter your expense and budget. 
The expenses are listed in Table View in the middle of the app. 
Your budget, total expenses, and budget status (whether you are under or over budget) will be printed on the text area on the bottom.
